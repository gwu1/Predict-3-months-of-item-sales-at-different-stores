# Sales Prediction README

This repository contains code for a sales prediction project. The goal of this project is to develop a model that predicts sales based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided in two files:

- `train.csv`: This file contains the training data with features and corresponding sales values.
- `test.csv`: This file contains the test data with features for which predictions need to be made.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- Python 3.1
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```shell
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd sales-prediction`

3. Place the train.csv and test.csv files in the project directory.

4. Run the code:
Run all cells of `Predict 3 months of item sales at different stores.ipynb`

5. The predictions will be generated and saved in a file named submission.csv.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on a validation set. The lower the RMSE value, the better the model's predictions.
